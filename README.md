# Corona Analysis
Simple Dutch Covid-19 data visualisation in a Jupyter Notebook.

To me, it is crucial to visualise data to make sense of it. The daily updates like "x new covid cases, y more than yesterday" doesn't include nearly enough information to create a clear image. That's why I wrote this code to link to the Dutch RIVM data and create a plot every day.
In the news updates, the 'y more than yesterday' part, is also valuable, because it gives a sense of how fast the growth (new cases) is growing. In math terms, this is called the second derivative. You hardly see this data visualised though, but I includeded it in my graphs.
I'm very thankful for my astronomy and physics background, it allows me to quickly write some code to get a feeling for all kinds of different data. For those interested: my code can be found on https://github.com/camilledevalk/corona-analysis.
